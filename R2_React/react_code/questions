Question 1: 
Show 9 balloons (colored circles). Every 2 seconds, a random balloon turns red (active). If clicked within 1 second, score +1. Otherwise, it bursts (vanishes). Game resets after 10 rounds.

Question 2: 
Simulate a horizontal row of 10 "LEDs". On click of a “Start” button, LEDs light up one after another (with 300ms delay). After all light up, turn off in reverse order. Repeat 3 times.

Question 3: 
Create a 5x5 grid of tiles. One random tile has a hidden "treasure".
User can click up to 3 tiles to try finding it.
Each clicked tile reveals a message: “Too Far”, “Close”, or “You Found It!” based on Manhattan distance to the treasure.
If not found in 3 tries, reveal the treasure location with a golden glow.

Question 4: 
A sequence of 4 colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) flashes in random order (1s per flash).
User then clicks the colors in the same order.
If correct, show “Level Up!” and add one more color to the sequence.
If incorrect, flash red and restart.

Question 5: 
You have 4 potted plants on screen. Each plant has a moisture bar (from 100% to 0%).
Every second, moisture reduces by 5%.
Clicking a plant waters it (+30% moisture, max 100%).
If moisture hits 0%, the plant dies (turns brown).
After 1 minute, display how many plants you kept alive.
